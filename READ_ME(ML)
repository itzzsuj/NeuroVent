# NeuroXAI: AI-Driven Cognitive Monitoring System

Project Overview

NeuroXAI is a machine learning-powered cognitive health monitoring system designed to analyze EEG data and predict cognitive decline in asthma patients. The project utilizes Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for efficient, real-time processing of brainwave signals and applies AI models to generate personalized therapy recommendations.

Machine Learning Pipeline

1. Data Collection

EEG signals are recorded from patients performing cognitive tests.

Preprocessing includes noise filtering, artifact removal, and signal normalization.

Data is stored securely for model training and inference.

2. Feature Extraction

Extract key EEG metrics such as band power, coherence, and spike train patterns.

Convert EEG signals into features suitable for SNN-based classification.

3. Model Training

Implement Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for efficient and biologically inspired EEG analysis.

Train models on labeled cognitive decline datasets, ensuring high sensitivity and specificity.

Use PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Neuromorphic AI frameworks (such as NEST or Intel Loihi) for optimized performance.

4. Prediction & Analysis

Predict cognitive decline levels based on real-time EEG inputs.

Generate trend-based line graphs comparing patient EEG patterns to healthy baselines.

Provide AI-driven insights on cognitive function deterioration and improvement recommendations.

5. Therapy Recommendation Model

Process EEG data trends to suggest personalized therapy exercises.

Adapt therapy plans dynamically based on patient progress and EEG feedback.

Deploy recommendation logic within a secure, user-accessible mobile application.
